# Valkey Operator - Requirements

*draft*

## Main Components

### 1. Valkey Operator

**Role:** Main orchestrator

**Functionalities:**
- watch and act on new CRs:
  - creates new clusters
  - upgrades clusters
  - scales clusters (plus resharding)
- detects Valkey cluster drifts (statefulsets, config maps, secrets etc)
- communicates with **sidecar**
- maintains certificates for Valkey TLS and for commmunication with **sidecar** (mTLS)
  - internal 
  - *(optional)* external, using Cert manager, for TLS (and future mTLS in Valkey)
- *(optional)* injects Valkey exporter for Prometheus
- can be cluster level or namespaced (different RBACs)

### 2. Valkey Sidecar

**Role:** Valkey node coordinator

**Functionalities:**
- listen for commands from **operator**
- reports statuses back to **operator**
- promote/demote Valkey cluster nodes
- trap SIGTERM and acts on pod deletion
- responsible with pod readiness and liveness
- heartbeat back to the **operator**

### 3. Valkey Operator Web UI

**Role:** UI for Operator

### Cluster Backup

TBD

### Cluster Restore

TBD

## Features (unorganized)

### Operator SDK Capabilities
The Operator SDK (Go-based) scaffolds a controller that can:
- Watch and reconcile custom and native Kubernetes resources.
- Create, update, and delete resources declaratively.
- React to events (add/update/delete) and status changes.
- Manage finalizers to delay deletion.
- Patch resources dynamically.
- Integrate webhooks to validate or mutate resources.
- Handle leader election, metrics, and health checks.

### CR Changes

### **Operator** recovery and resources reconciliation from restart/scale 0

### Resources identification

Mark all created kubernetes resources (statefulsets, configmaps, secrets, pvcs, svcs, pdbs etc) with an annotation, to clearly link them to the `ValkeyCluster`. Like
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    valkey.io/cr: valkey-poc    # name of the ValkeyCluster
    valkey.io/locked: "true"    # maybe...
  ownerReferences:
    # etc
```

All created CRs must have set correct `ownerReferences`.

### Unbound Valkey cluster from **operator**

If the user wishes to take control over Valkey cluster, it will be allowed to remove `valkey.io/cr: valkey-poc` from `statefulset`. After doing this, the operator will perform the following:
- clear all other annotations from resources
- will clear all statuses from `ValkeyClusterStatus` and will change to
```yaml
status:
  phase: Unbound
```
**TBD:** what to do and how, if user wants it back

### Validation Webhooks

In order to distinguish changes self vs others, **operator** generates a unique token per update. The webhook maintains a short-lived cache of valid tokens. Once used, the token is invalidated.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    valkey.io/update-token: "abc123"
```

All other changes are rejected. Exceptions are pods, for `delete`.

### Operator - Sidecar communication

**Operator** is mostly idle, the **sidecarâ€™s** heartbeat is low-frequency and lightweight. The communication will be
- **Sidecar** initiated - Heartbits or major events: HTTP/1.1. Major events can be Valkey failed, someone deleted the pod
- **Operator** initiated - rest of communication: gRPC - only **orchestrator** open channels to needed **sidecars** when orchestration is triggered. Even use short-lived gRPC streams if needed.

### mTLS

**Operator** generates a root CA on install, saved in ValkeyCA. For each Valkey cluster, it generates an intermediate CA, saved in ValkeyCertificateBundle. The mTLS and TLS certificates are mounted from secrets in containers as volumes. must mount CA in containers in ca-bundle. On cert change, **Sidecar** will reload and use it. **Operator** will accept a period of time (1m? 1h?) the older cert. After all sidecars are switched, will unload it from memory and *(TBD)* will clean ValkeyCertificateBinding of deprecated.

**AuthN/AuthZ:** use SPIFFE-style SANs to authorize requests (e.g. only sidecars with CN `valkey-poc-sidecar` can respond).

Protobuf contracts with versioning.

### Pods deletion blocking

When a pod needs to be recreated, the following steps will be taken:
1. Patch PDB to minAvailable: N-1. This temporarily allows exactly one Pod to be disrupted
2. Delete or restart one Pod
3. Start a validation webhook and deny changes on rest of the pods (from same statefulset)
4. Wait for the Pod to become healthy
5. Patch PDB back to minAvailable: 100%
6. Stop validation webhook

Ways of blocking/delaying pod delete

**Finalizers** - on pod delete, on CR delete (cleanup Valkey resources). On pods, they must be injected (PATCH) after creation
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  finalizers:
  - valkey.io/finalizer
```

**Statefulset Update Strategy - on delete:** this will not update any pods if something changes. it will create a pod with new spec only on delete
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: valkey
spec:
  serviceName: "valkey"
  replicas: 6
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: valkey
  updateStrategy:
    type: OnDelete
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: valkey
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: valkey
```

**Pod Lifecycle** - `preStop` is called and waited before SIGTERM is sent
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: lifecycle-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: lifecycle-demo-container
    image: nginx
    lifecycle:
      postStart:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Hello from the postStart handler > /usr/share/message"]
      preStop:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh","-c","nginx -s quit; while killall -0 nginx; do sleep 1; done"]
```

**Pod Disruption Budget** - used with `minAvailable: 100%`. Only `--force --grace-period=0` will work
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: block-all-disruptions
spec:
  minAvailable: 100%
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-stateful-app
```

**Intercept deletion:** When a Pod is marked for deletion, Kubernetes sets `metadata.deletionTimestamp`.

### Others

**Status in CRs** - to reflect sidecar executions/Valkey cluster states  
**CRDs versioning** - as much as possible, do not change anything, add (with defaults)  
**Observability** - metrics (Prometheus), logging (structured)  
**Valkey /data** - accesible also from sidecar  
**Valkey /tmp** - common between containers

### How a pod can be deleted

#### Voluntary Deletion Scenarios (Intentional)

| Trigger                           | Who Initiates         | Can Be Blocked? |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `kubectl delete pod`              | User                  | Fin, PDB, VH    |

| Trigger                                 | Cause                       | Can Be Blocked? |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Node failure                            | Node becomes unreachable    | No              |
| Resource pressure (memory, disk)        | Kubelet eviction            | No              |
| Pod TTL (ttlSecondsAfterFinished)       | TTL controller              | Fin             |
| Pod owner deletion (e.g. Job)           | OwnerReference with cascade | Fin             |
| Force delete `--force --grace-period=0` | User override               | Fin, VH         |

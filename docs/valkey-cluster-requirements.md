# Valkey Operator - Requirements

*draft*

## Main Components

### 1. Valkey Operator

**Role:** Main orchestrator

**Functionalities:**
- watch and act on new CRs:
  - creates new clusters
  - upgrades clusters
  - scales clusters (plus resharding)
- detects Valkey cluster drifts (statefulsets, config maps, secrets etc)
- communicates with **sidecar**
- maintains certificates for Valkey TLS and for commmunication with **sidecar** (mTLS)
  - internal 
  - *(optional)* external, using Cert manager, for TLS (and future mTLS in Valkey)
- *(optional)* injects Valkey exporter for Prometheus
- can be cluster level or namespaced (different RBACs)

### 2. Valkey Sidecar

**Role:** Valkey node coordinator

**Functionalities:**
- listen for commands from **operator**
- reports statuses back to **operator**
- promote/demote Valkey cluster nodes
- trap SIGTERM and acts on pod deletion
- responsible with pod readiness and liveness
- heartbeat back to the **operator**

### 3. Valkey Operator Web UI

**Role:** UI for Operator

> **Important:** Valkey 9 comes with client mTLS. To be studied.

### Cluster Backup

TBD

### Cluster Restore

TBD

## Features (unorganized)

### CR Changes
TBD

### **Operator** recovery and resources reconciliation from restart/scale 0
TBD

### Resources identification

Mark all created kubernetes resources (statefulsets, configmaps, secrets, pvcs, svcs, pdbs etc) with an annotation, to clearly link them to the `ValkeyCluster`. Like
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    valkey.io/cr: valkey-poc    # name of the ValkeyCluster
    valkey.io/locked: "true"    # maybe...
  ownerReferences:
    # etc
```

All created CRs must have set correct `ownerReferences`.

### Unbound Valkey cluster from **operator**

If the user wishes to take control over Valkey cluster, it will be allowed to remove `valkey.io/cr: valkey-poc` from `statefulset`. After doing this, the operator will perform the following:
- clear all other annotations from resources
- will clear all statuses from `ValkeyClusterStatus` and will change to
```yaml
status:
  phase: Unbound
```
**TBD:** what to do and how, if user wants it back

### Validation Webhooks

In order to distinguish changes self vs others, **operator** generates a unique token per update. The webhook maintains a short-lived cache of valid tokens. Once used, the token is invalidated.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    valkey.io/update-token: "abc123"
```

All other changes are rejected. Exceptions are pods, for `delete`.

### Operator - Sidecar communication

**Operator** is mostly idle, the **sidecarâ€™s** heartbeat is low-frequency and lightweight. The communication will be
- **Sidecar** initiated - Heartbits or major events: HTTP/1.1. Major events can be Valkey failed, someone deleted the pod
- **Operator** initiated - rest of communication: gRPC - only **orchestrator** open channels to needed **sidecars** when orchestration is triggered. Even use short-lived gRPC streams if needed.

### mTLS

**Operator** generates a root CA on install, saved in ValkeyCA. For each Valkey cluster, it generates an intermediate CA, saved in ValkeyCertificateBundle. The mTLS and TLS certificates are mounted from secrets in containers as volumes. must mount CA in containers in ca-bundle. On cert change, **Sidecar** will reload and use it. **Operator** will accept a period of time (1m? 1h?) the older cert. After all sidecars are switched, will unload it from memory and *(TBD)* will clean ValkeyCertificateBinding of deprecated.

**AuthN/AuthZ:** use SPIFFE-style SANs to authorize requests (e.g. only sidecars with CN `valkey-poc-sidecar` can respond).

Protobuf contracts with versioning.

### Pods deletion blocking

When a pod needs to be recreated, the following steps will be taken:
1. Patch PDB to minAvailable: N-1. This temporarily allows exactly one Pod to be disrupted
2. Delete or restart one Pod
3. Start a validation webhook and deny changes on rest of the pods (from same statefulset)
4. Wait for the Pod to become healthy
5. Patch PDB back to minAvailable: 100%
6. Stop validation webhook

Ways of blocking/delaying pod delete

**Finalizers** - on pod delete, on CR delete (cleanup Valkey resources). On pods, they must be injected (PATCH) after creation
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  finalizers:
  - valkey.io/finalizer
```

**Statefulset Update Strategy - on delete:** this will not update any pods if something changes. it will create a pod with new spec only on delete
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: valkey
spec:
  serviceName: "valkey"
  replicas: 6
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: valkey
  updateStrategy:
    type: OnDelete
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: valkey
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: valkey
```

**Pod Lifecycle** - `preStop` is called and waited before SIGTERM is sent
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: lifecycle-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: lifecycle-demo-container
    image: nginx
    lifecycle:
      postStart:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Hello from the postStart handler > /usr/share/message"]
      preStop:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh","-c","nginx -s quit; while killall -0 nginx; do sleep 1; done"]
```

**Pod Disruption Budget** - used with `minAvailable: 100%`. Only `--force --grace-period=0` will work
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: block-all-disruptions
spec:
  minAvailable: 100%
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-stateful-app
```

**Intercept deletion:** When a Pod is marked for deletion, Kubernetes sets `metadata.deletionTimestamp`.

### ACL creation and rotation

#### Creation
Store pregenerated ACL file as a Kubernetes Secret

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: valkey-poc-acl
type: Opaque
stringData:
  users.acl: |
    user admin on >StrongPassword +@all ~*
```

Mount it as a read-only volume:
```yaml
# container spec
volumeMounts:
- name: acl-volume
  mountPath: /etc/valkey/acl
  readOnly: true
volumes:
- name: acl-volume
  secret:
    secretName: valkey-acl
# ...
# pod spec
volumes:
- name: users-acl-volume
  secret:
    secretName: valkey-poc-acl
    items:
    - key: users.acl
      path: users.acl
```
Reference it in `valkey.conf`:
```ini
aclfile /etc/valkey/acl/users.acl
```

#### Secret rotation
When a change in `ValkeyClusterAcl` or in secret is detected and reconciled, the following happens:
1. **Operator** creates the new secret with the rendered users.acl
2. **Operator** opens grpc with all sidecars
3. **Operator** confirms with all sidecars that ACL is ok (do we need to test k8s here?)
4. **Operator** asks for acl reapply
5. **Sidecar** checks if its password changed
6. **Sidecar** connects to Valkey and executes
```resp
ACL LOAD
```
7. **Sidecar** (if password changed, reconnects and) checks ACL
```resp
ACL LIST
```
8. **Sidecar** reports back status
9. **Operator** change status in `ValkeyClusterAcl`

### Deferred executions

There are cases when one object depends on another. Use Indexing for Reverse Lookup: with [controller-runtime](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime), index the CRs by the Secrets they reference:

```go
mgr.GetFieldIndexer().IndexField(&ValkeyClusterAcl{}, "spec.secrets.secretName", func(obj client.Object) []string {
    return []string{obj.(*ValkeyClusterAcl).Spec.Secrets.SecretName}
})
```
Then, when a Secret changes, list all CRs that reference it:

```go
var aclList ValkeyClusterAclList
r.List(ctx, &aclList, client.MatchingFields{"spec.secrets.secretName": secret.Name})
```

The reconcile loop should:
- check if the Secret exists and is complete
- if not, set `status.phase`: `WaitingForSecret` and requeue
- if yes, proceed with work and update `status.phase`: `Applied`

Practicly, we have the following rules
1. When a CR changes, reconcile it
2. When a Secret changes, reconcile all CRs that reference it
3. Use Status to Track Progress
```yaml
status:
  phase: WaitingForSecret
  lastChecked: 2025-09-07T19:17:00Z
  missingKeys:
    - valkey-user-pass
```

Actual Known Deps:
| Who | DependsOn | Why/What |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| ValkeyCluster | ValkeyCertificateBundle | Intermediate CA for mTLS (and TLS) |
| ValkeyCluster | ValkeyCertificateBinding | Certs for mTLS (and TLS) |
| ValkeyCluster | ValkeyClusterAcl | Certs for mTLS (and TLS) |
| ValkeyCertificateBundle | ValkeyCertificateCA | Operator CA |
| ValkeyCertificateBundle | Secret | the secret that holds the intermediate certs |
| ValkeyCertificateBinding | ValkeyCertificateBundle | the issuer for certs |
| ValkeyCertificateBinding | Secrets | the secrets that hold the certs for mTLS (and TLS) |
| ValkeyClusterAcl | Secret | the secret that holds the ACL definitions |

### Others

**Status in CRs** - to reflect sidecar executions/Valkey cluster states  
**CRDs versioning** - as much as possible, do not change anything, add (with defaults)  
**Observability** - metrics (Prometheus), logging (structured)  
**Valkey /data** - accesible also from sidecar  
**Valkey /tmp** - common between containers

## Vars

### Operator SDK Capabilities
The Operator SDK (Go-based) scaffolds a controller that can:
- Watch and reconcile custom and native Kubernetes resources.
- Create, update, and delete resources declaratively.
- React to events (add/update/delete) and status changes.
- Manage finalizers to delay deletion.
- Patch resources dynamically.
- Integrate webhooks to validate or mutate resources.
- Handle leader election, metrics, and health checks.

### Core Principles for Operator SDK Development
1. Declarative First
- Treat the Custom Resource (CR) as the source of truth.
- Reconciliation logic should always aim to bring the system to the desired state described in the CR.
- Avoid imperative hacksâ€”let Kubernetes do the heavy lifting.
2. Idempotency
- Every reconciliation loop should be safe to repeat.
- No side effects from duplicate executions.
- This ensures stability, especially during retries or restarts.
3. Event-Driven, Not Time-Driven
- Watch relevant resources (CRs, Secrets, ConfigMaps, etc.)
- Avoid polling or time-based triggers unless absolutely necessary.
- Use indexing and dependency tracking to respond intelligently to changes.
4. Status Is a First-Class Citizen
- Use the status field to reflect runtime state, errors, and progress.
- This improves observability, debugging, and auditability.
- Think of status as your operatorâ€™s dashboard.
5. Graceful Error Handling
- Donâ€™t crash or panicâ€”report errors in status, log clearly, and retry safely.
- Use exponential backoff or rate limiting if needed.
6. Validation and Admission Control
- Validate CRs before acting on them.
- Use OpenAPI schemas, webhooks, or preflight checks to catch misconfigurations early.
7. Security by Design
- Minimize RBAC permissionsâ€”follow least privilege.
- Avoid mounting Secrets unless necessary.
- Sanitize inputs and avoid leaking sensitive data in logs or status.
8. Modular and Extensible
- Keep your reconciliation logic clean and composable.
- Use helper functions, services, or sub-controllers for complex workflows.
- Make it easy to extend without rewriting everything.
9. Resilience Across Restarts
- Avoid in-memory state that doesnâ€™t survive Pod restarts.
- Use Kubernetes-native constructs (labels, annotations, status) to track progress.
10. GitOps Compatibility
- Design your CRs and workflows to be declarative and version-controlled.
- Avoid side effects that arenâ€™t reflected in the CR spec.
- Make your operator predictable in CI/CD pipelines.
11. Observability & Metrics
- Emit Prometheus metrics for reconciliation success/failure, duration, and resource health.
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs or resource names.
- Integrate with tracing if your operator spans multiple systems.

### Valkey ACL
Valkey ACL is built to be backward-compatible. That means, by default, Valkey ships with a built-in user called `default`, which has full access to all commands and keys unless explicitly restricted. It is the infered user for legacy mode, where no user is provided.
```sh
# legacy mode, "default" is infered
AUTH myPass
# ACL mode
AUTH myUser myPass
```

Bootstrap strategy for ACL implementation:
1. Lock Down the Default User Immediately. In `valkey.conf`, do the following:
```ini
# Set a strong password for the default user
requirepass "myPass"

# Disable dangerous commands if needed (TBD)
rename-command FLUSHALL ""
rename-command CONFIG ""
```
2. Use the `default` user to create a named superuser
```sh
AUTH myPass
# create your named superuser:
ACL SETUSER valkey-admin on >myValkeyAdminPass +@all ~*
# disable or Restrict the Default User
ACL SETUSER default off
# or restrict it severely
ACL SETUSER default on >someOtherPassword -@all ~none
```
3. Persist ACLs Securely
Valkey stores ACLs in memory. To persist them, use the aclfile directive in `valkey.conf`:
```ini
aclfile /etc/valkey-acl/users.acl
```
Export your ACL rules
```sh
# ensures your ACLs survive restarts and are version-controlled if needed.
ACL SAVE
```

### How a pod can be deleted

#### Voluntary Deletion Scenarios (Intentional)

| Trigger                           | Who Initiates         | Can Be Blocked? |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
